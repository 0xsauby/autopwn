Specify targets and run sets of tools against them

autopwn is supposed to make a pentester's life easier by allowing
them to specify tools they would like to run against targets, without
having to type them all the time or write some dodgy script. This
tool will also be useful during certain exams I suspect..

Core concepts of this project are:
1. Quickness - Specify targets and run pre-defined assessments against them
2. Easiness - Tool should be easy to use and write tools and assessments for
3. Recon - This tool should be considered for recon purposes only. I wouldn't rely on this script to automatically identify and exploit issues (even though the tool name sort of implies such skiddy concepts)
